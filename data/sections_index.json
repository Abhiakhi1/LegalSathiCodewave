The primary objective of this law is not to shut down businesses, but to provide a mechanism for their revival and rehabilitation. If revival is not possible, it provides for an orderly and fair process of liquidation, where the assets of the debtor are distributed among the creditors. In India, this field was historically governed by a fragmented set of laws, leading to long delays and inefficient outcomes.

For decades, the food sector was governed by multiple laws, leading to confusion and overlap. This was fundamentally changed by the enactment of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, which consolidated all previous food-related laws into a single, comprehensive statute. The law now follows an integrated \"farm-to-fork\" approach, establishing a single reference point for all matters relating to food safety and standards.\n\nPART I: THE PRIM"

The Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (PFA Act) [Repealed] Description: This was the primary law governing food safety in India for over five decades before it was repealed and replaced by the FSS Act, 2006. The PFA Act's main objective was to prevent the adulteration of food. However, it was criticized for its narrow focus on adulteration rather than the broader concept of food safety, and for its punitive rather than preventive approach. The FSS Act, 2006, represents a paradigm shift from the PFA regime by adopting a science-based, risk-assessment approach to food safety.\n\nPART III: OTHER RELEVANT LAWS\n1.
