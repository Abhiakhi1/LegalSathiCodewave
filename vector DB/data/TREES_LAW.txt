INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF TREES LAW
What is Trees Law?
Trees Law in India is not a single, codified field but a mosaic of laws, rules, and regulations at the central, state, and local levels, all aimed at the preservation and protection of trees and forests. This body of law recognizes the critical ecological role of trees and seeks to regulate their felling, transport, and management. The legal framework is rooted in the Constitution of India, where "Forests" is a subject in the Concurrent List, allowing both the Centre and the States to legislate on it. Key constitutional provisions include Article 48A (a Directive Principle of State Policy to protect and improve the environment and safeguard forests) and Article 51A(g) (a Fundamental Duty of every citizen to protect and improve the natural environment, including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife). The law addresses trees within designated forest areas as well as those on private and public lands in rural and urban areas.

PART I: LAWS GOVERNING FORESTS
1. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980
Description: This is a powerful and concise central legislation enacted to provide for the conservation of forests and to check the indiscriminate diversion of forest land for non-forest purposes. It acts as a federal check on the power of State Governments to de-reserve forests or use forest land for other activities.

Key Provisions:

Restriction on the de-reservation of forests or use of forest land for non-forest purpose (Section 2): This is the heart of the Act. It mandates that no State Government or other authority shall make any order directing:

that any reserved forest shall cease to be reserved;

that any forest land may be used for any non-forest purpose;

that any forest land may be assigned by way of lease to any private person or non-governmental entity;

that any forest land may be cleared of trees which have grown naturally for the purpose of using it for reafforestation;
without the prior approval of the Central Government.

Associated Legal Terminology:

Forest Land: The term "forest" is not defined in the Act, but the Supreme Court in the landmark T.N. Godavarman Thirumulpad v. Union of India case held that it includes not only forests as understood in the dictionary sense, but also any area recorded as forest in the Government records, irrespective of ownership.

Non-forest purpose: Any purpose other than reafforestation, such as the cultivation of crops, construction of buildings, mining, or any other industrial or commercial activity.

2. The Indian Forest Act, 1927
Description: This is a foundational colonial-era Act that consolidates the law relating to forests, the transit of forest-produce, and the duty leviable on timber and other forest-produce. It provides the machinery for the administration and protection of forest areas.

Key Provisions:

Classification of Forests: The Act provides for the declaration and management of three types of forests:

Reserved Forests (Chapter II): These are the most protected forests, where most activities like felling of trees, grazing, and hunting are prohibited unless specifically permitted.

Village-Forests (Chapter III): A reserved forest can be constituted as a village-forest for the benefit of a village community.

Protected Forests (Chapter IV): The State Government can declare any land which is not a reserved forest as a "protected forest." It can prohibit certain acts like the felling of trees, quarrying, and clearing of land for cultivation in such forests.

Control over Timber and other Forest-Produce (Chapter V): The Act empowers the State Government to regulate the transit of all timber and other forest-produce.

Penalties and Procedure (Chapter IX): Prescribes penalties for various forest offenses, such as felling trees or setting fire to a reserved forest.

Associated Legal Terminology:

Forest-produce: Includes timber, charcoal, rubber, catechu, wood-oil, resin, natural varnish, bark, lac, mahua flowers, and other specified items, as well as wild animals, skins, tusks, and horns.

Timber: Includes trees when they have fallen or have been felled, and all wood whether cut up or fashioned or hollowed out for any purpose or not.

Reserved Forest: A specific area of forest that is given a high degree of protection from human activities.

PART II: LAWS GOVERNING TREES OUTSIDE FORESTS
1. State Tree Preservation / Protection Acts
Description: Since the felling of trees on non-forest land is primarily a state subject, most states have enacted their own specific laws to regulate the felling of trees on private and public lands in both urban and rural areas. These Acts are crucial for protecting the green cover outside designated forests.

Example: The Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Preservation of Trees Act, 1975

Applicability: Applies to all urban areas in the State of Maharashtra.

Key Provisions:

Establishment of a Tree Authority (Section 3): Every urban local authority is required to constitute a Tree Authority for the preservation of trees.

Restriction on felling of trees (Section 8): This is the core provision. It prohibits any person from felling any tree without the previous permission in writing of the Tree Officer.

Procedure for Permission: A person must apply to the Tree Officer for permission, giving the reasons for felling the tree. The Tree Authority is required to hold an inquiry and may grant or refuse permission.

Duty to Replant: As a condition for granting permission, the Tree Authority generally requires the applicant to plant new trees in place of the ones being felled.

Heritage Trees: The Act was amended to include provisions for the protection of "heritage trees" (trees of an estimated age of 50 years or more), with much stricter conditions for their felling.

Associated Legal Terminology:

Tree Authority: A statutory body constituted at the local level (e.g., in a Municipal Corporation) to oversee the preservation of trees.

Felling of a tree: Includes acts of burning, cutting, or in any way damaging a tree.

Heritage Tree: A tree of a certain age (e.g., 50 years or more) that is given special protection due to its ecological and aesthetic value.

PART III: OTHER RELEVANT LAWS
1. The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972
Description: While its primary focus is on the protection of wild animals, this Act is highly relevant to trees and flora through its provisions for habitat protection and the specific protection of certain plant species.

Key Provisions:

Protection of Habitats: By providing for the declaration of National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries, the Act protects entire ecosystems, including the trees and vegetation within these areas, which form the habitat for wildlife.

Protection of Specified Plants (Schedule VI): This schedule lists specific endemic plants that are given protection. Section 17A of the Act prohibits any person from willfully picking, uprooting, damaging, destroying, acquiring, or collecting any specified plant from any forest land or any area specified by the Central Government.

Associated Legal Terminology:

Habitat: Includes land, water or vegetation which is the natural home of any wild animal.

Specified Plant: A plant species that is listed in Schedule VI of the Act and is thereby protected from being picked, uprooted, or damaged.

2. The Biological Diversity Act, 2002
Description: This Act was enacted to implement the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). It aims to conserve biological diversity, ensure its sustainable use, and enable the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of biological resources.

Key Provisions:

Regulation of Access to Biological Resources: The Act regulates access to biological resources (which include plants, animals, and micro-organisms) and associated traditional knowledge for research or commercial utilization. Any person seeking access must obtain prior approval from the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) or the State Biodiversity Board (SBB).

Benefit Sharing: The Act mandates that the benefits arising from the use of biological resources must be shared in a fair and equitable manner with the local communities who have conserved these resources and held the traditional knowledge related to them.

Associated Legal Terminology:

Biological Resources: Plants, animals and micro-organisms or parts thereof, their genetic material and by-products with actual or potential use or value, but does not include human genetic material.

Benefit Sharing: The sharing of profits, royalties, or other benefits that arise from the commercial use of biological resources or traditional knowledge with the communities that provide them.
