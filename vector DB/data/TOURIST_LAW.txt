INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF TOURIST LAW
What is Tourist Law?
Tourist Law in India is not a single, codified field but a composite area of law that brings together various statutes and regulations governing the entry, stay, and activities of tourists. The legal framework is designed to regulate the movement of foreign nationals, ensure their safety, and manage their engagement with the country's economic and cultural resources. The Constitution of India places subjects like citizenship, extradition, passports, and visas in the Union List, giving the Central Government the primary authority to legislate on matters concerning foreign nationals. This body of law covers everything from visa and registration requirements to foreign exchange regulations and the protection of cultural and natural heritage sites that tourists visit.
