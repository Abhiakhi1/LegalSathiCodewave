INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW
What is Public International Law?
Public International Law is the body of legal rules, norms, and standards that apply between sovereign states and other entities that are legally recognized as international actors. It governs the relationships between states in matters such as war, peace, diplomacy, trade, and human rights. Unlike domestic law, which is created by a national legislature, international law primarily derives from international conventions (treaties), customary state practice, and general principles of law. In India, the Constitution provides a framework for the application of international law. Article 51 of the Constitution directs the State to foster respect for international law and treaty obligations, and Article 253 empowers the Parliament to enact laws to implement international treaties.

PART I: CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
The Constitution of India, 1950

Description: The Constitution of India lays down the principles for the country's engagement with the international community and provides the legal authority for the incorporation of international law into the domestic legal system.

Key Provisions:

Article 51 (Promotion of international peace and security): This is a Directive Principle of State Policy which states that the State shall endeavor to:

(a) promote international peace and security;

(b) maintain just and honorable relations between nations;

(c) foster respect for international law and treaty obligations in the dealings of organized peoples with one another; and

(d) encourage settlement of international disputes by arbitration.

Article 253 (Legislation for giving effect to international agreements): This article gives the Parliament of India the overriding power to make any law for the whole or any part of the territory of India for implementing any treaty, agreement, or convention with any other country or countries or any decision made at any international conference, association, or other body. This power allows the Parliament to legislate on subjects that are normally in the State List if it is necessary to implement an international obligation.

Seventh Schedule (Union List, Entries 10-21): These entries give the Union Government exclusive legislative power over matters related to foreign affairs, including diplomatic relations, United Nations Organisation, participation in international conferences, entering into and implementing treaties, war and peace, and extradition.

Associated Legal Terminology:

Treaty: A formally concluded and ratified agreement between states.

International Customary Law: Rules of law derived from the consistent practice of States acting out of a sense of legal obligation.

Dualism: The legal theory that international law and domestic law are two separate legal systems. For an international law to apply domestically, it must be expressly incorporated into domestic law through legislation. India largely follows this principle.

Monism: The legal theory that international and domestic law form a single, unified legal system.
