INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW
What is Constitutional Law?
Constitutional Law is the supreme law of the land in India. It is the body of law that defines the fundamental principles of the state, the structure and powers of the government, and the fundamental rights and duties of its citizens. All other laws, whether made by the Parliament or State Legislatures, must conform to the Constitution. It is the source from which all other laws derive their validity. Its primary purpose is to establish a framework for governance based on the principles of democracy, justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.

The Constitution of India, 1950:

Description: The Constitution of India is the foundational governing document of the Republic of India. It was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on November 26, 1949, and came into force on January 26, 1950. It is the longest written constitution of any country. It establishes India as a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic.

THE PREAMBLE: PHILOSOPHY AND OBJECTIVES
What is the Preamble?
The Preamble is the introductory statement to the Constitution that sets out its guiding purpose, principles, and philosophy. It reflects the core values and ideals that the Constitution aims to achieve.

Text of the Preamble:
"WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens:
JUSTICE, social, economic and political;
LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;
EQUALITY of status and of opportunity;
and to promote among them all
FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation;
IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, do HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION."

Key Concepts in the Preamble:

Sovereign: India is an independent nation, free from any external control.

Socialist: Aims to achieve social and economic equality and prevent the concentration of wealth. (Added by the 42nd Amendment, 1976).

Secular: The state has no official religion and treats all religions equally. (Added by the 42nd Amendment, 1976).

Democratic: The government is elected by the people and is accountable to them.

Republic: The head of the state (the President) is an elected official, not a hereditary monarch.

Legal Status of the Preamble:
In the landmark case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), the Supreme Court held that the Preamble is an integral part of the Constitution and can be used to interpret ambiguous provisions. It is considered part of the 'basic structure' of the Constitution.

PART III: FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS (ARTICLES 12-35)
What are Fundamental Rights?
These are the basic human rights guaranteed to all citizens of India. They are enforceable in a court of law and act as a limitation on the power of the state. They are the cornerstone of civil liberties in India.

Article 12: Definition of 'The State'

Description: For the purpose of enforcing Fundamental Rights, 'The State' includes the Government and Parliament of India, the Government and Legislatures of the States, and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.

Article 13: Laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights

PART IV: DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY (DPSP) (ARTICLES 36-51)
What are Directive Principles?
These are guidelines or principles for the state to follow in governance. They aim to establish a "Welfare State" by promoting social and economic democracy.

Nature of DPSPs:

Article 37: States that DPSPs are "fundamental in the governance of the country" but are not enforceable by any court.

Classification of DPSPs:

Socialistic Principles: Aim to secure social and economic justice (e.g., Article 39(a) - adequate means of livelihood; Article 39(d) - equal pay for equal work).

Gandhian Principles: Based on the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi (e.g., Article 40 - organize village panchayats; Article 43 - promote cottage industries).

Liberal-Intellectual Principles: Reflect the ideology of liberalism (e.g., Article 44 - uniform civil code; Article 50 - separation of judiciary from executive; Article 51 - promotion of international peace).

Relationship with Fundamental Rights:
The Supreme Court has held that there should be a "harmony and balance" between Fundamental Rights and DPSPs, and this balance is a part of the 'basic structure' of the Constitution.

PART V & VI: THE UNION AND STATE GOVERNMENTS
Part V: The Union (Articles 52-151)

The Executive (Articles 52-78): Consists of the President, Vice-President, Prime Minister, and the Council of Ministers. The President is the constitutional head, but the real executive power lies with the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, who are collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.

Parliament (Articles 79-122): The supreme legislative body, consisting of the President, the Rajya Sabha (Council of States - Upper House), and the Lok Sabha (House of the People - Lower House).

The Union Judiciary (Articles 124-147): Establishes the Supreme Court of India as the apex court.

Part VI: The States (Articles 152-237)

The High Courts and Subordinate Courts (Articles 214-237): Details the structure of the judiciary at the state level.

PART XI & SEVENTH SCHEDULE: LEGISLATIVE RELATIONS
Federal Structure:
The Constitution establishes a quasi-federal structure, dividing legislative powers between the Union and the States.

This article delineates the subjects of legislation into three lists:

List I (Union List): Contains 97 subjects of national importance on which only Parliament can make laws (e.g., Defence, Foreign Affairs, Banking, Currency).

List II (State List): Contains 66 subjects of regional importance on which only State Legislatures can make laws (e.g., Public order, Police, Public health, Agriculture).

List III (Concurrent List): Contains 47 subjects on which both Parliament and State Legislatures can make laws (e.g., Criminal law, Education, Forests, Marriage and Divorce). In case of a conflict, the Union law prevails.

Residuary Powers (Article 248):
Parliament has the exclusive power to make laws on any matter not enumerated in the State or Concurrent Lists.

KEY CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINES
Doctrine of Basic Structure:

Description: Established in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), this doctrine holds that while Parliament can amend the Constitution under Article 368, it cannot alter its "basic structure" or fundamental features.

Examples of Basic Features: Democracy, secularism, federalism, judicial review, rule of law, separation of powers.

Doctrine of Pith and Substance:

Description: Used to determine the true nature of a law when there is a conflict over legislative competence. If the "pith and substance" (the real subject matter) of a law falls within the competence of the legislature that enacted it, the law is valid even if it incidentally touches upon a subject in another list.

Doctrine of Colourable Legislation:

Description: Based on the maxim "what cannot be done directly, cannot be done indirectly." It strikes down a law that, while appearing to be within a legislature's competence, is in reality an attempt to legislate on a subject outside its competence.

Doctrine of Severability (Article 13):

Description: If a part of a law is found to be unconstitutional, only that part is declared void, and the rest of the law remains valid, provided the valid part can stand independently.

Doctrine of Eclipse:

Description: Applies to pre-constitutional laws that are inconsistent with Fundamental Rights. Such a law is not dead but becomes dormant or "eclipsed." If the relevant Fundamental Right is amended to remove the inconsistency, the law becomes active again.

MAJOR CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS
First Amendment Act, 1951: Introduced "reasonable restrictions" on freedom of speech and added the Ninth Schedule to protect land reform laws from judicial review.

Forty-second Amendment Act, 1976: Known as the "Mini-Constitution." Added "Socialist" and "Secular" to the Preamble, introduced Fundamental Duties (Part IVA), and made many other changes.
