INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF TRAFFIC LAW
What is Traffic Law?
Traffic Law in India is the body of law that governs and regulates traffic on roads. It is a critical component of the broader Transport & Motor Vehicles Law, focusing specifically on the rules of the road, the conduct of drivers, and the penalties for violations. The primary objective of traffic law is to ensure the safe and orderly movement of traffic, prevent road accidents, and protect the lives and property of all road users. The entire legal framework for traffic regulation in India is consolidated within The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, made thereunder. The law was significantly strengthened by the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, which introduced substantially higher penalties for traffic offenses to create a stronger deterrent effect.

PART I: THE PRIMARY LEGISLATION
1. The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988
Description: This is the principal legislation in India that consolidates and amends the law relating to motor vehicles. Its provisions on licensing, vehicle standards, and rules of the road form the core of Indian traffic law. The Act is enforced by the traffic police and the Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) of the respective states.

Key Provisions Governing Traffic Law:

Licensing of Drivers of Motor Vehicles (Chapter II):

Necessity for driving licence (Section 3): This is the foundational rule of traffic law, making it illegal for any person to drive a motor vehicle in a public place without a valid driving licence.

Disqualification and Endorsement: The Act gives licensing authorities and courts the power to disqualify a person from holding a licence or to endorse the licence for certain offenses.

Registration of Motor Vehicles (Chapter IV):

Necessity for registration (Section 39): Mandates that every motor vehicle must be registered and must display its registration mark (number plate) in the prescribed manner. Driving an unregistered vehicle is a serious offense.

Control of Traffic (Chapter VIII):

Rules of the Road (Section 119): Every driver of a motor vehicle shall drive the vehicle in conformity with the signals, signs, and the rules of the road.

Speed Limits (Section 112): Prohibits driving a motor vehicle at a speed exceeding the maximum speed fixed for that type of vehicle and road.

Signals and Traffic Signs: The Act provides for the erection of traffic signs and signals, and it is mandatory for drivers to obey them.

Insurance of Motor Vehicles Against Third Party Risks (Chapter XI):

Necessity for insurance (Section 146): Makes it mandatory for every vehicle to have at least a third-party insurance policy to be used in a public place. Driving without valid insurance is a punishable offense.

Offences, Penalties and Procedure (Chapter XIII): This chapter is the enforcement arm of traffic law. The 2019 amendment drastically increased the penalties for common traffic violations to improve compliance. Key offenses include:
