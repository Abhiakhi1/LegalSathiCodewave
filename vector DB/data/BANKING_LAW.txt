INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF BANKING LAW
What is Banking Law?
Banking Law is the body of law that governs the functioning of banks and financial institutions. It provides the legal framework that regulates how banks are formed, licensed, and operated, and it governs the relationship between banks and their customers. In India, "Banking" is a subject in the Union List of the Constitution, giving the Parliament exclusive power to legislate on it. The primary objective of banking law is to ensure the stability and integrity of the financial system, protect the interests of depositors, facilitate credit and commerce, and implement the country's monetary policy. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as the central bank, is the principal regulator of the banking sector in India.

PART I: THE PRIMARY LEGISLATIONS
1. The Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (RBI Act)
Description: This is the foundational statute that established the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as the country's central bank. The Act lays down the constitution, powers, and functions of the RBI. It empowers the RBI to act as the issuer of currency, the government's banker, the commercial banks' banker, and the overall regulator of the financial and monetary system in India.

Key Provisions:

Establishment and incorporation of Reserve Bank (Section 3): Provides for the establishment of the RBI as a body corporate.

Sole right to issue bank notes (Section 22): Grants the RBI the exclusive right to issue bank notes in India.

Banker to Governments (Sections 20, 21, & 21A): The RBI is obligated to act as the banker to the Central Government and can also act as the banker to State Governments by agreement.

Banker to Banks: The Act requires scheduled banks to maintain a certain percentage of their deposits as a cash reserve with the RBI, known as the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR). This allows the RBI to act as the lender of last resort to banks.

Monetary Policy: The Act empowers the RBI to operate the monetary policy of the country. This includes the power to determine the policy rates (like the repo rate and reverse repo rate) to control inflation and regulate the money supply in the economy.

2. The Banking Regulation Act, 1949
Description: This is a comprehensive Act that provides the legal framework for the regulation of all banking firms in India. While the RBI Act focuses on the RBI's role as the central bank, this Act gives the RBI its specific powers to regulate commercial banks. It aims to ensure the sound and orderly development of the banking system.

Key Provisions:

Definition of 'Banking' (Section 5(b)): Defines banking as "the accepting, for the purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the public, repayable on demand or otherwise, and withdrawable by cheque, draft, order or otherwise."

A holder in due course gets a good title to the instrument even if the title of the transferor was defective.

Dishonour of Cheque for insufficiency, etc., of funds in the account (Section 138): This is the most significant provision in modern banking practice. It makes the dishonour of a cheque a criminal offense. If a person draws a cheque which is returned unpaid by the bank due to insufficient funds, the drawer of the cheque can be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with a fine which may extend to twice the amount of the cheque, or with both. The provision is subject to certain conditions, such as the cheque being presented within its validity period and the payee sending a legal notice demanding payment within 30 days of the dishonour.
