FAMILY LAW DATASET
INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF FAMILY LAW
What is Family Law?
Family Law, also known as Personal Law, in India is a unique feature of its legal system. It governs personal matters such as marriage, divorce, succession, inheritance, adoption, and guardianship. India does not have a uniform civil code; instead, these matters are governed by different laws based on the religious affiliation of the individuals involved. This creates a pluralistic legal framework with distinct codes for Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Parsis, and others, coexisting with secular laws that are available to all citizens irrespective of their religion.
