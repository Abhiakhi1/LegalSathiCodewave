INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF WOMEN'S LAW
What is Women's Law?
Women's Law in India is not a single, codified field but a broad area of law that encompasses a range of constitutional provisions and specific legislations aimed at achieving gender equality, protecting women from violence and discrimination, and empowering them socially, economically, and politically. The foundation of this law is the Constitution of India, which not only guarantees equality (Article 14) but also empowers the State to make special provisions for the benefit of women (Article 15(3)). Over the years, a robust legal framework has been developed to address specific issues faced by women, including domestic violence, dowry, sexual harassment at the workplace, and other forms of gender-based crimes.

PART I: CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS
1. The Constitution of India, 1950

Key Provisions:

Preamble: Aims to secure to all its citizens "equality of status and of opportunity."

Fundamental Rights (Part III):

Article 14 (Right to Equality): Guarantees that the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws.

Article 15 (Prohibition of Discrimination): Prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth. Crucially, Article 15(3) empowers the State to make any special provision for women and children. This is a key enabling provision for laws that provide special protections or benefits to women.
