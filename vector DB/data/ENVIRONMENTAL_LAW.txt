INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW
What is Environmental Law?
Environmental Law in India is a body of laws, rules, regulations, and judicial precedents that govern the protection of the natural environment. It has evolved significantly over the last few decades, driven by constitutional mandates, international commitments, and judicial activism. The Constitution of India provides the foundation for environmental protection. Article 21 (Right to Life) has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to include the right to a healthy and clean environment. Furthermore, Article 48A (a Directive Principle of State Policy) directs the State to protect and improve the environment, while Article 51A(g) (a Fundamental Duty) imposes a duty on every citizen to protect and improve the natural environment. This field of law aims to prevent pollution, conserve natural resources, and ensure sustainable development.

PART I: UMBRELLA LEGISLATION
1. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986
Description: This is a comprehensive and powerful "umbrella" legislation that provides a framework for the coordination of activities of various central and state authorities established under other environmental laws.

Description: This was the first major legislation enacted in India to specifically address the problem of water pollution. Its primary objective is to provide for the prevention and control of water pollution and the maintaining or restoring of the wholesomeness of water. It established the institutional framework for pollution control by creating the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs).

It provides for the prevention, control, and abatement of air pollution. The Act empowers the CPCB and SPCBs (established under the Water Act) to also implement its provisions.

Key Provisions:

Power to declare air pollution control areas (Section 19): The State Government, after consultation with the SPCB, may declare any area or areas within the State as air pollution control areas.

Restrictions on use of certain industrial plants (Section 21): No person shall, without the previous consent of the State Board, establish or operate any industrial plant in an air pollution control area.

Power of entry and inspection (Section 24): Empowers any person authorized by a board to enter and inspect any place for the purpose of performing any of the functions of the board.

Non-forest purpose: Any purpose other than reafforestation, such as the cultivation of crops, construction of buildings, or mining.

PART IV: ADJUDICATORY BODY
1. The National Green Tribunal Act, 2010
