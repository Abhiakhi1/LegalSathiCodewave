INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW
What is Intellectual Property Law?
Intellectual Property (IP) Law is the branch of law that deals with the protection of creations of the human mind. It grants the creator certain exclusive rights to use their creation for a certain period of time. The main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage innovation and creativity by allowing creators to benefit from their work. In India, the legal framework for IP is well-developed and compliant with international standards, particularly the TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Agreement. The law covers various forms of IP, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and designs.

PART I: PATENTS
1. The Patents Act, 1970
Description: This Act is the primary legislation that governs the patent system in India. It was enacted to provide a legal framework for the protection of inventions and to encourage scientific research, innovation, and industrial progress. The Act has been significantly amended, most notably in 2005, to comply with India's obligations under the TRIPS Agreement.

Key Provisions:

What can be Patented (Section 3): The Act specifies what are not considered inventions, thereby defining what is patentable. An invention is patentable if it is a new product or process involving an inventive step and is capable of industrial application. Things that are not patentable include frivolous inventions, discoveries of scientific principles, methods of agriculture, and computer programs per se.

Term of Patent (Section 53): The term of every patent granted is twenty years from the date of filing the patent application.

Rights of Patentee (Section 48): A patent grants the patentee the exclusive right to prevent third parties from making, using, selling, or importing the patented invention without their consent.

Compulsory Licensing (Sections 84-92): To prevent the abuse of patent rights and to ensure that patented inventions are available to the public at reasonable prices, the Act contains provisions for the grant of compulsory licenses. A compulsory license can be granted after three years from the grant of a patent if the reasonable requirements of the public have not been met or if the patented invention is not available at a reasonably affordable price.

Infringement of Patents (Section 104): The Act provides for civil remedies for the infringement of a patent, including injunctions and damages.

Associated Legal Terminology:

Patent: An exclusive right granted for an invention, which is a product or a process that provides a new way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a problem.

Invention: A new product or process involving an inventive step and capable of industrial application.

Inventive Step: A feature of an invention that involves technical advance as compared to the existing knowledge or having economic significance or both and that makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art.

Prior Art: All information that has been made available to the public in any form before a given date that might be relevant to a patent's claims of originality.

Compulsory License: An authorization given by the government to a third party to make, use, or sell a patented invention without the consent of the patent owner.

PART II: TRADEMARKS
1. The Trade Marks Act, 1999
Description: This Act governs the law relating to trademarks in India. It provides for the registration of trademarks, the protection of trademarks used in relation to goods and services, and the prevention of the use of fraudulent marks.

Key Provisions:

Definition of 'Trade Mark' (Section 2(1)(zb)): A trademark is a mark capable of being represented graphically and which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of others. It may include the shape of goods, their packaging, and combination of colours.

Registration of Trade Marks (Chapter III): The Act provides for the registration of trademarks with the Trade Marks Registry. Registration gives the proprietor the exclusive right to use the trademark in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered.

Term of Registration (Section 25): The registration of a trademark is initially for a period of ten years, but can be renewed from time to time for further periods of ten years.

Infringement of Registered Trade Marks (Section 29): A registered trademark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor, uses a mark which is identical with, or deceptively similar to, the registered trademark in the course of trade.

Associated Legal Terminology:

Trademark: A sign, design, or expression which identifies products or services of a particular source from those of others.

Service Mark: A trademark used to identify a service rather than a product.

Well-known Mark: A mark which has become so well-known to the substantial segment of the public which uses such goods or receives such services that the use of such mark in relation to other goods or services would be likely to be taken as indicating a connection between those goods or services and the owner of the well-known mark.

Deceptively Similar: A mark is considered deceptively similar to another if it so nearly resembles that other mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion.

Passing Off: The common law tort of misrepresenting one's own goods or services as those of another.

PART III: COPYRIGHT
1. The Copyright Act, 1957
Description: This Act is a comprehensive legislation that protects the rights of creators of original literary, dramatic, musical, and artistic works, as well as cinematograph films and sound recordings. It grants the creator a bundle of exclusive rights over their work.
