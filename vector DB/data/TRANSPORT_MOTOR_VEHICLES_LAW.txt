INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF TRANSPORT & MOTOR VEHICLES LAW
What is Transport & Motor Vehicles Law?
Transport & Motor Vehicles Law in India is the body of law that governs all aspects of road transport. It is a comprehensive legal framework designed to regulate the use of motor vehicles, ensure the safety of roads, and provide a system for compensating victims of road accidents. The primary legislation governing this field is The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, which has been significantly amended to address the challenges of increasing motorization and to improve road safety. The subject of "mechanically propelled vehicles" is in the Concurrent List of the Constitution, which means both the Central and State governments can legislate on it, leading to a combination of central laws and state-specific rules.

PART I: THE PRIMARY LEGISLATION
1. The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988
Description: This is the principal legislation in India that consolidates and amends the law relating to motor vehicles. It is a comprehensive Act that covers the entire ecosystem of road transport, including the licensing of drivers, the registration of vehicles, the control of transport vehicles through a permit system, mandatory third-party insurance, and the penalties for traffic offenses. The Act was substantially amended by the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019, which introduced stricter penalties, new offenses, and a greater focus on technology and safety.

Key Provisions:

Licensing of Drivers of Motor Vehicles (Chapter II):

Necessity for driving licence (Section 3): Mandates that no person shall drive a motor vehicle in any public place unless they hold an effective driving licence issued to them authorising them to drive the vehicle.

Age limit (Section 4): Sets the minimum age for obtaining a driving licence (e.g., 18 years for a motor car, 20 years for a transport vehicle).

Learner's and Permanent Licence: The Act provides for a two-stage licensing process, starting with a learner's licence followed by a permanent licence after passing a driving test.

Registration of Motor Vehicles (Chapter IV):

Necessity for registration (Section 39): Mandates that no person shall drive any motor vehicle and no owner of a motor vehicle shall cause or permit the vehicle to be driven in any public place unless the vehicle is registered in accordance with this chapter.

Registration Certificate (RC): The registration of a vehicle is recorded in a Registration Certificate (RC), which serves as the primary proof of ownership and legality of the vehicle.

Control of Transport Vehicles (Chapter V):

Necessity for permits (Section 66): Requires the owner of a motor vehicle to obtain a permit to use the vehicle as a transport vehicle (e.g., as a taxi, bus, or goods carrier).

Insurance of Motor Vehicles Against Third Party Risks (Chapter XI):

Necessity for insurance against third party risk (Section 146): This is a crucial social welfare provision. It makes it mandatory for the owner of every motor vehicle to have an insurance policy that covers their liability in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person (a "third party") or damage to any property of a third party caused by the use of the vehicle.

Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals (MACT) (Section 165): The Act provides for the establishment of specialized tribunals (MACTs) for the purpose of adjudicating upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of, or bodily injury to, persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles. This provides a speedy and specialized forum for accident victims to seek compensation.

Offences, Penalties and Procedure (Chapter XIII):

Penalties for various offenses: This chapter lists numerous traffic offenses and their corresponding penalties. The 2019 amendment significantly increased the fines and punishments for offenses like driving without a licence, over-speeding, drunken driving, driving without a helmet or seatbelt, and driving without valid insurance.

New Offenses: The amendment introduced new offenses, such as penalties for road contractors for faulty road design and for failing to provide a safe passage for emergency vehicles like ambulances.

Associated Legal Terminology:

Motor Vehicle: Any mechanically propelled vehicle adapted for use upon roads, whether the power of propulsion is transmitted thereto from an external or internal source.

Driving Licence: The document issued by a competent authority authorising the person specified therein to drive a motor vehicle.

Registration Certificate (RC): A document that serves as proof of registration of a motor vehicle.

Permit: An authorisation issued by a Regional or State Transport Authority to use a motor vehicle as a transport vehicle.

Third-Party Insurance: A mandatory insurance policy that provides coverage against legal liability to a third party arising from an accident. The "third party" is any person other than the owner and the insurer of the vehicle.

Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (MACT): A quasi-judicial body established to adjudicate upon claims for compensation related to motor vehicle accidents.

Golden Hour: A provision introduced by the 2019 amendment, which refers to the one-hour time period following a traumatic injury during which there is the highest likelihood that prompt medical treatment will prevent death. The Act provides for the protection of "Good Samaritans" who help accident victims during this period.
