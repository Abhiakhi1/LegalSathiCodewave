INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF PROPERTY LAW
What is Property Law?
Property Law in India is the body of law that governs the various forms of ownership and tenancy in both movable and immovable property. Property is broadly classified into two categories: movable property (like goods, vehicles, or securities) and immovable property (like land and buildings). This legal field encompasses the rights and interests associated with property, and the methods by which these rights can be transferred from one person to another. The foundational statutes governing property law in India include the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, which deals with transfers between living persons, the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, for movable property, and the Registration Act, 1908, for formalizing transactions in immovable property.

PART I: LEGISLATIONS GOVERNING IMMOVABLE PROPERTY
1. The Transfer of Property Act, 1882
Description: This is the principal legislation in India that regulates the transfer of property between living persons (inter vivos). It provides a systematic and uniform law for the transfer of both movable and immovable property by acts of parties and covers various modes of transfer such as sale, mortgage, lease, exchange, and gift.

Key Provisions:

Sale (Section 54): Defines a sale as a transfer of ownership in exchange for a price. It mandates that a sale of immovable property of a value of one hundred rupees and upwards can be made only by a registered instrument.

Mortgage (Section 58): The transfer of an interest in specific immovable property for the purpose of securing a loan. The Act defines various types of mortgages.

Lease (Section 105): A transfer of a right to enjoy such property, made for a certain time, in consideration of a price paid or promised (rent). Leases of immovable property for any term exceeding one year must be made by a registered instrument.

Gift (Section 122): The transfer of existing movable or immovable property made voluntarily and without consideration. A gift of immovable property must be effected by a registered instrument.

Its primary purpose is to provide a method of public registration of documents to give notice to the world of legal rights and obligations arising from them, ensure authenticity, and prevent fraud. It is a crucial procedural law for real estate transactions.

Key Provisions:

Documents of which Registration is Compulsory (Section 17): This is the most critical section. It mandates the registration of certain documents relating to immovable property, including instruments of gift, sale deeds for property valued at Rs. 100 or more, and leases for a term exceeding one year.

Key Provisions:

Contract of Sale (Section 4): Defines a "sale" (where property in goods is transferred immediately) and an "agreement to sell" (where transfer is to take place at a future time).

Conditions and Warranties (Sections 11-17): Differentiates between a "condition" (a stipulation essential to the main purpose of the contract) and a "warranty" (a stipulation collateral to the main purpose). It also lays down implied conditions, such as the seller's right to sell and that the goods correspond with the description.

Transfer of Property (Sections 18-26): Specifies the rules for determining when the ownership (property) of the goods passes from the seller to the buyer. This is crucial for determining who bears the risk of loss.
