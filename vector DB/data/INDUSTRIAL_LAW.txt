INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL LAW
What is Industrial Law?
Industrial Law is the branch of law that governs industrial relations, meaning the relationship between employers, employees, and trade unions within an industrial setting. Its primary objective is to maintain industrial peace and harmony, prevent and settle industrial disputes, and regulate the conditions of labor in industrial establishments. This legal framework is crucial for ensuring fair labor practices, protecting the rights of workers, and providing a stable environment for industrial production and economic growth. The law addresses issues such as trade unionism, collective bargaining, strikes, lock-outs, retrenchment, and the safety and welfare of workers in factories.
