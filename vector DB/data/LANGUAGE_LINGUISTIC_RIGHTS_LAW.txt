INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF LANGUAGE LAW
What is Language Law?
Language Law in India is a body of law that addresses the country's profound linguistic diversity. India does not have laws that are "against" any mother language. Instead, it has a complex legal framework, rooted in the Constitution, designed to manage the use of different languages in administration, education, and public life, while simultaneously protecting the rights of linguistic minorities. The Constitution does not establish a single "national language" but provides for "official languages" for the Union and the States. The core of this law is the balance between promoting a common language for official communication (Hindi) and safeguarding the rich heritage of the numerous regional languages spoken across the country.

PART I: CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR LANGUAGE
1. The Constitution of India, 1950
Description: The Constitution contains extensive provisions that form the bedrock of India's language policy and the protection of linguistic rights.

Key Provisions:

Fundamental Rights of Linguistic Minorities (Part III):

Article 29 (Protection of interests of minorities): This is a crucial right. It guarantees that any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India having a distinct language, script or culture of its own shall have the right to conserve the same. It also prohibits denial of admission into any educational institution maintained by the State on grounds only of language.

Article 30 (Right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions): Guarantees all minorities, whether based on religion or language, the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.

Official Language (Part XVII): This part details the official language policy of India.

Article 343 (Official language of the Union): Declares Hindi in Devanagari script as the official language of the Union. It also provided for the continued use of English for all official purposes of the Union for a period of fifteen years from the commencement of the Constitution.

Article 345 (Official language or languages of a State): Empowers the Legislature of a State to adopt any one or more of the languages in use in that State or Hindi as the language to be used for all or any of the official purposes of that State.

Article 348 (Language to be used in the Supreme Court and in the High Courts): Stipulates that all proceedings in the Supreme Court and in every High Court shall be in the English language until Parliament by law otherwise provides.

Article 350A (Facilities for instruction in mother-tongue at primary stage): This is a directive provision. It states that it shall be the endeavor of every State to provide adequate facilities for instruction in the mother-tongue at the primary stage of education to children belonging to linguistic minority groups.

The Eighth Schedule: This schedule of the Constitution lists the recognized languages of India. Recognition under this schedule accords a language official status and prestige. The Government of India is under an obligation to take measures for the development of these languages. As of 2024, there are 22 languages in the Eighth Schedule.

Associated Legal Terminology:

Official Language: A language given a special legal status in a particular country, state, or other jurisdiction, typically used in its government and judiciary.

Linguistic Minority: A community of people whose mother tongue is different from the majority of the people in a state or a part of a state.

Eighth Schedule: The list of officially recognized languages of the Republic of India.

PART II: KEY LEGISLATION
1. The Official Languages Act, 1963
Description: This Act was enacted by the Parliament to provide for the languages which may be used for the official purposes of the Union, for transaction of business in Parliament, for Central and State Acts, and for certain purposes in High Courts. It was passed to give effect to the constitutional provisions and to address the concerns of non-Hindi speaking states.

Key Provisions:

Continuance of English language for official purposes of the Union and for use in Parliament (Section 3): This is the most significant provision of the Act. It provides for the continuing use of the English language, in addition to Hindi, for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before the expiry of the fifteen-year period stipulated in the Constitution. It effectively established a bilingual policy for the Union's official work.

Authorised Hindi translation of Central Acts, etc. (Section 5): Provides for the publication of an authoritative text in Hindi of all Central Acts and Ordinances.

Associated Legal Terminology:

Bilingualism: The policy of using two official languages for government business.

PART III: KEY POLICIES AND JUDICIAL PRINCIPLES
1. The Three-Language Formula
Description: This is not a law but a major language-in-education policy formulated by the Government of India in consultation with the states. It is a consensus-based policy designed to promote multilingualism and national integration.

Key Principles:

First Language: The mother tongue or the regional language.

Second Language: In Hindi-speaking states, this would be another modern Indian language or English. In non-Hindi speaking states, this would be Hindi or English.

Third Language: In Hindi-speaking states, this would be English or a modern Indian language not studied as the second language. In non-Hindi speaking states, this would be English or a modern Indian language not studied as the second language.

Implementation: The implementation of this formula lies with the State Governments and has varied across the country, often becoming a subject of political and social debate.

2. Judicial Interpretation
Description: The Supreme Court and various High Courts have played a crucial role in interpreting the constitutional provisions related to language and protecting the rights of linguistic minorities.

Key Principles Upheld by Courts:

Right to Conserve Language: The courts have upheld the right of linguistic minorities under Article 29 to conserve their language, which includes the right to agitate for the protection of that language.

Medium of Instruction: While recognizing the importance of the mother tongue in primary education (Article 350A), the courts have also held that a student or a parent has the right to choose the medium of instruction in education. The state cannot impose a single language as the exclusive medium of instruction.

Equality of Languages: The courts have affirmed that all the languages listed in the Eighth Schedule are national languages and must be treated with equal respect.
