INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW
This dataset provides information on significant Indian laws that have been repealed, deleted, or substantially changed over time. It is designed to train a legal chatbot to understand the evolution of the Indian legal framework and to distinguish between historical and current laws. For each entry, this document details the historical law, its key provisions, and a comparative analysis with the current legislation that has replaced it.

1. SUBSTANTIVE CRIMINAL LAW
A. HISTORICAL LAW: The Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC)
Status: Repealed and replaced.

Description: The IPC was the primary substantive criminal code of India for over 160 years. It was a comprehensive code that defined various offenses and prescribed their punishments, forming the bedrock of criminal law in the country.

Key Historical Provisions:

Defined offenses against the human body (murder, culpable homicide, kidnapping, rape).

Defined offenses against property (theft, extortion, robbery, cheating).

Contained provisions for offenses against the State, most notably Sedition (Section 124A), which criminalized acts causing "disaffection" against the government.

B. CURRENT LAW: The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 (BNS)
Effective Date: July 1, 2024.

Description: The BNS is the new substantive criminal code of India. It retains many core offenses from the IPC but introduces significant changes, new offenses, and a revised structure.

C. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: IPC vs. BNS
Repeal of Sedition: The most significant change is the repeal of the offense of sedition (Section 124A of IPC). It is replaced by Section 152 of the BNS, which penalizes acts that endanger the sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India, such as exciting secession or armed rebellion.

New Offences: The BNS introduces new, codified offenses that were not explicitly defined in the IPC, including:

Terrorist Act (Section 113)

Organised Crime (Section 111)

Mob Lynching (Section 103(2))

New Punishments: The BNS introduces community service as a form of punishment for certain petty offenses.

Focus: The BNS aims to shift the focus from a purely punitive system to one that is more justice-oriented (nyaya), as reflected in its title.

2. PROCEDURAL CRIMINAL LAW
A. HISTORICAL LAW: The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC)
Status: Repealed and replaced.

Description: The CrPC was the primary legislation governing the procedural aspects of criminal law. It provided the framework for police investigation, arrest, bail, trial processes, and appeals.

Key Historical Provisions:

Established the hierarchy of criminal courts.

Laid down the procedure for filing a First Information Report (FIR).

Detailed the different types of trials (Sessions trial, Warrant trial, Summons trial).

B. CURRENT LAW: The Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS)
Effective Date: July 1, 2024.

Description: The BNSS is the new procedural law that has replaced the CrPC. It aims to make the criminal justice process more efficient and transparent, with a heavy emphasis on the use of technology.

C. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: CrPC vs. BNSS
Use of Technology: The BNSS mandates the use of audio-video electronic means for various procedures, including the examination of witnesses and the recording of search and seizure.

Mandatory Forensics: Forensic investigation is now mandatory for offenses punishable with seven years of imprisonment or more.

Strict Timelines: The BNSS introduces strict timelines for various stages, such as the filing of a charge sheet and the pronouncement of judgment, to reduce delays.

Trial in Absentia: A new provision allows for the trial and judgment in the absence of a proclaimed offender who has absconded.

Statutory Recognition of Zero FIR: The concept of a "Zero FIR" (an FIR that can be filed in any police station, regardless of jurisdiction) is given statutory recognition.

3. LAW OF EVIDENCE
A. HISTORICAL LAW: The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (IEA)
Status: Repealed and replaced.

Description: The IEA was the foundational law governing the admissibility of evidence in Indian courts for over 150 years.

Key Historical Provisions:

Defined what facts are relevant and admissible.

Classified evidence as oral and documentary.

Dealt with the burden of proof and the examination of witnesses. Electronic evidence was dealt with under Section 65B, treating it largely as secondary evidence.

B. CURRENT LAW: The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023 (BSA)
Effective Date: July 1, 2024.

Description: The BSA is the new law of evidence in India. It retains the core principles of the IEA but significantly modernizes the rules to accommodate electronic and digital evidence.

C. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: IEA vs. BSA
Electronic Evidence: This is the most significant change. The BSA gives electronic records the same legal effect, validity, and enforceability as paper records.

Primary Evidence: The BSA clarifies that electronic records, such as a video recording, can be considered primary evidence, a major shift from the IEA.

Admissibility: The conditions for the admissibility of electronic records are now more comprehensively integrated into the main body of the law.

4. COMPETITION LAW
A. HISTORICAL LAW: The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act, 1969
Status: Repealed and replaced.

Description: The MRTP Act was the first competition law in India. Its primary focus was on curbing monopolies and preventing the concentration of economic power. It was a reform-era law aimed at controlling large industrial houses.

Key Historical Provisions:

Regulated monopolies.

Prohibited Monopolistic and Restrictive Trade Practices.

B. CURRENT LAW: The Competition Act, 2002
Effective Date: Enacted in 2002, with most provisions coming into force by 2009.

Description: This Act marked a paradigm shift in India's approach to competition. Instead of focusing on curbing monopolies, its objective is to promote and sustain competition in the market.

C. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: MRTP Act vs. Competition Act
Philosophical Shift: The MRTP Act was focused on the size of the enterprise and aimed to control monopolies. The Competition Act focuses on the conduct of enterprises and aims to prohibit the abuse of a dominant position. Under the new law, being dominant is not illegal, but abusing that dominance is.

New Concepts: The Competition Act introduced new concepts aligned with global standards, such as the regulation of "combinations" (mergers and acquisitions) to prevent their adverse effect on competition, and the prohibition of anti-competitive agreements (cartels).

Regulatory Body: The MRTP Commission under the old Act had limited powers. It was replaced by the Competition Commission of India (CCI), which is a more powerful and proactive regulator with powers of investigation and the ability to impose significant penalties.

5. LAND ACQUISITION LAW
A. HISTORICAL LAW: The Land Acquisition Act, 1894
Status: Repealed and replaced.

Description: This was the colonial-era law that governed the process by which the government could acquire private land for public purposes.

Key Historical Provisions:

Granted wide powers to the government to acquire land.

Compensation was based on the market value of the land.

It was criticized for its coercive nature and for not having adequate provisions for the rehabilitation and resettlement of displaced people.

B. CURRENT LAW: The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (LARR Act)
Effective Date: January 1, 2014.

Description: This Act was enacted to provide a more humane and transparent process for land acquisition.

C. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: 1894 Act vs. LARR Act, 2013
Compensation: The LARR Act provides for significantly higher compensation, which can be up to four times the market value in rural areas and twice the market value in urban areas.

Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R): The LARR Act mandates a comprehensive R&R package for all affected families, not just landowners. This was a major lacuna in the old Act.

Consent Clause: For the acquisition of land for public-private partnership (PPP) projects and for private companies, the consent of 70% and 80% of affected families, respectively, is now required.

Social Impact Assessment (SIA): The LARR Act makes a Social Impact Assessment study mandatory before any acquisition, to assess the social costs and benefits of the project.
