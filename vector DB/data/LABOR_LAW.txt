INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF LABOR LAW
What is Labor Law?
Labor Law is the body of law that governs the relationship between employers, employees, trade unions, and the government. Its primary objective is to ensure social justice and economic security for the workforce. In India, "Labour" is a subject in the Concurrent List of the Constitution, allowing both the Central and State governments to legislate on it. The legal framework is vast and complex, comprising numerous statutes that regulate industrial relations, wages, social security, and working conditions. The Directive Principles of State Policy (e.g., Articles 39, 41, 42, 43) also provide a guiding philosophy for labor legislation, aiming to secure a living wage, humane conditions of work, and participation of workers in management.

Recent Reforms: The Four Labour Codes
It is important to note that the Government of India has recently consolidated 29 central labor laws into four comprehensive codes to simplify and modernize the legal framework. These are:

The Code on Wages, 2019

The Industrial Relations Code, 2020

The Code on Social Security, 2020

The Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020
While these codes have been enacted, their full implementation is being rolled out in phases. This dataset primarily details the key provisions of the pre-existing, foundational laws that the codes seek to amalgamate.
