INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF ANIMAL LAW
What is Animal Law?
Animal Law in India is a body of laws, rules, and judicial precedents that govern the legal, social, and moral status of animals. It is an emerging field that encompasses the protection of animals from cruelty, the conservation of wildlife, and the regulation of the use of animals in various sectors like entertainment, research, and agriculture. The foundation for animal protection in India is derived from the Constitution. Article 51A(g), a Fundamental Duty, enjoins every citizen "to have compassion for living creatures." Furthermore, the Directive Principle of State Policy under Article 48A directs the State to protect and safeguard wildlife. The Supreme Court of India has also interpreted the fundamental Right to Life under Article 21 to include the right to a healthy environment, which is essential for the well-being of both humans and animals.

PART I: PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS
1. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 (PCA Act)
Description: This is the principal legislation enacted to prevent the infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering on animals and to amend the laws relating to the prevention of cruelty to animals. It is a comprehensive Act that covers all animals and establishes the institutional framework for animal welfare in India through the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI).

Key Provisions:

Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) (Chapter II): The Act provides for the establishment of the AWBI. Its functions are primarily advisory and include advising the government on animal welfare policies, promoting financial assistance to animal welfare organizations, and imparting education on the humane treatment of animals.

Cruelty to animals generally (Section 11): This is the most critical provision of the Act. It defines "cruelty" by listing various acts that are considered offenses. These include:

Beating, kicking, overriding, overloading, or torturing any animal.

Willfully and unreasonably administering any injurious drug or substance.

Confining any animal in a cage that is not large enough to permit a reasonable opportunity for movement.

Keeping an animal chained for an unreasonable time.

Failing to provide sufficient food, water, or shelter.

Abandoning any animal in circumstances which render it likely that it will suffer pain by reason of starvation or thirst.

Experimentation on animals (Chapter IV): The Act regulates experiments on animals. It mandates that experiments can be performed only for the purpose of advancing knowledge that will be useful for saving or prolonging life, or alleviating suffering. It also provides for the constitution of a Committee for the Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA).

Performing animals (Chapter V): This chapter deals with the exhibition and training of performing animals. It prohibits the exhibition or training of any animal without a registration with the prescribed authority.

Associated Legal Terminology:

Animal: Any living creature other than a human being.

Cruelty: Any act or omission that causes unnecessary pain or suffering to an animal, as detailed in Section 11 of the Act.

Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI): A statutory advisory body on animal welfare laws and for the promotion of animal welfare in the country.

Owner: In relation to an animal, includes not only the owner but also any other person for the time being in possession or custody of the animal.

PART II: WILDLIFE PROTECTION
1. The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972
Description: This is a comprehensive Act that provides for the protection of India's wild animals, birds, and plant species, in order to ensure environmental and ecological security. It established a framework for the creation of protected areas and prohibits the hunting and trade of specified species.

Key Provisions:

Schedules of Protected Species (Schedules I-VI): The Act classifies wildlife into different schedules based on their conservation status.

Schedule I & Part II of Schedule II: Species listed here are afforded absolute protection, and offenses under these are prescribed the highest penalties.

Schedule III & IV: Also protected, but penalties are lower.

Schedule V: Contains animals which may be hunted (e.g., vermin).

Schedule VI: Contains specified endemic plants which are prohibited from cultivation and planting.

Prohibition of Hunting (Section 9): Prohibits the hunting of any wild animal specified in Schedules I, II, III, and IV. Hunting is defined very broadly to include capturing, killing, poisoning, snaring, and trapping.

Declaration of Protected Areas (Chapter IV): Empowers the State Government to declare any area as a:

Wildlife Sanctuary: An area of adequate ecological, faunal, floral, or zoological significance for the purpose of protecting, propagating, or developing wildlife or its environment.

National Park: An area that is of ecological, faunal, floral, or zoological importance, which is set aside for the protection of wildlife and biodiversity. Stricter rules apply to National Parks compared to Sanctuaries.

Regulation of Trade in Wildlife (Chapter V & VA): Prohibits the trade and commerce in wild animals, animal articles, and trophies derived from specified species.

Constitution of Authorities: The Act provides for the establishment of various statutory bodies, such as the National Board for Wild Life, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), and the Central Zoo Authority.

Associated Legal Terminology:

Wildlife: Includes any animal, bees, butterflies, crustacean, fish and moths; and aquatic or land vegetation which forms part of any habitat.

Habitat: Includes land, water or vegetation which is the natural home of any wild animal.

Hunting: Includes capturing, killing, poisoning, snaring, and trapping of any wild animal and every attempt to do so.
