INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF CORPORATE LAW
What is Corporate Law?
Corporate Law (also known as Company Law) is the body of law that governs the rights, relations, and conduct of persons, companies, organizations, and businesses. It deals with the formation, funding, governance, and dissolution of corporations. The primary objective of corporate law in India is to regulate the functioning of companies, protect the interests of various stakeholders like shareholders, creditors, and employees, and promote transparency and accountability in corporate governance. It provides the legal framework that allows businesses to operate as distinct legal entities, separate from their owners.

PART I: COMPANY FORMATION AND GOVERNANCE
1. The Companies Act, 2013
Description: The Companies Act, 2013 is the primary legislation that regulates the incorporation of a company, its responsibilities, directors, and dissolution. It replaced the erstwhile Companies Act, 1956, and introduced significant changes to align Indian corporate law with global standards. It governs all types of companies, whether public or private, listed or unlisted.

Key Provisions:

Types of Companies (Sections 2 & 3): The Act primarily defines three types of companies:

Public Company: A company that is not a private company and has a minimum of seven members. It can offer its shares to the public.

Its primary objective is to maximize the value of assets of such persons, promote entrepreneurship, and balance the interests of all stakeholders.

PART IV: KEY DOCTRINES IN CORPORATE LAW
Doctrine of Corporate Veil (Separate Legal Personality):

Description: This is the most fundamental principle of company law. It establishes that a company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its members (shareholders). This "veil" separates the company's personality from its members, who are generally not liable for the company's debts.

Lifting or Piercing the Corporate Veil:

Description: In certain exceptional circumstances, the courts can disregard the separate personality of the company and look at the reality behind it, holding the members or directors personally liable. This is done to prevent fraud or improper conduct.

Doctrine of Ultra Vires:

Description: A Latin term meaning "beyond the powers." An act is ultra vires if it is beyond the scope of the powers of the company as defined in the objects clause of its Memorandum of Association. Such an act is void and cannot be ratified even by the unanimous consent of all shareholders.

Doctrine of Indoor Management (Turquand's Rule):

Description: This doctrine protects outsiders dealing with a company. It states that an outsider is entitled to assume that the internal procedures of the company have been complied with. They are not required to inquire into the regularity of the company's internal proceedings.

Doctrine of Constructive Notice:

Description: This doctrine operates against the person dealing with the company. Since the MOA and AOA are public documents registered with the RoC, every person dealing with the company is deemed to have knowledge of their contents.
