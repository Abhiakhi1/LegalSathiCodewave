INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF FOOD LAW
What is Food Law?
Food Law in India is a body of law that regulates the manufacture, storage, distribution, sale, and import of food to ensure the availability of safe and wholesome food for human consumption. The primary objective of this law is to protect public health by preventing food adulteration and contamination. For decades, the food sector was governed by multiple laws, leading to confusion and overlap. This was fundamentally changed by the enactment of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, which consolidated all previous food-related laws into a single, comprehensive statute. The law now follows an integrated "farm-to-fork" approach, establishing a single reference point for all matters relating to food safety and standards.

PART I: THE PRIMARY LEGISLATION
1. The Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 (FSS Act)
Description: This is the principal legislation that governs food safety and regulation in India. It consolidates various acts and orders that had previously handled food-related issues, such as the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, and the Fruit Products Order, 1955. The Act established the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) as the apex regulatory body for the food industry.

Key Provisions:

Establishment of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) (Chapter II): This is the cornerstone of the Act. It provides for the establishment of FSSAI as a statutory body responsible for:

Framing regulations to lay down food safety standards.

Laying down guidelines for the accreditation of laboratories for food testing.

Providing scientific advice and technical support to the Central and State Governments.

Collecting and collating data regarding food consumption, contamination, and emerging risks.

Promoting general awareness about food safety and food standards.

General Provisions as to Articles of Food (Chapter IV): This chapter defines various categories of food and related offenses.

Definitions: It provides clear definitions for key terms like "unsafe food," "sub-standard food," "misbranded food," and "adulterant."

Restrictions on certain articles: It places restrictions on the use of certain ingredients and substances in food.

Licensing and Registration of Food Business (Section 31): This is a crucial regulatory provision. It mandates that no person shall commence or carry on any food business except under a license or registration. This brings the entire food supply chain, from manufacturers to street vendors, under the regulatory ambit of the FSSAI and state food authorities.

Enforcement of the Act (Chapter VII): The Act provides for the appointment of a Commissioner of Food Safety for each state, along with Food Safety Officers and Designated Officers, to enforce the provisions of the Act at the state and local levels.

Offences and Penalties (Chapter IX): The Act prescribes graded penalties for various offenses. The penalties are more stringent than in the previous laws and are proportionate to the gravity of the offense. This includes:

Penalties for selling food not of the nature or substance or quality demanded.

Penalties for sub-standard or misbranded food.

Severe penalties, including imprisonment, for manufacturing or selling unsafe food that results in injury or death.

Adjudication and Food Safety Appellate Tribunal (Chapter X): The Act provides for the establishment of an Adjudicating Officer (for imposing penalties in lesser offenses) and a Food Safety Appellate Tribunal to hear appeals from the decisions of the Adjudicating Officer.

Associated Legal Terminology:

Food: Any substance, whether processed, partially processed or unprocessed, which is intended for human consumption.

Adulterant: Any material which is or could be employed for the purposes of adulteration.

Food Business Operator (FBO): Any person by whom the business is carried on or owned and is responsible for ensuring the compliance of this Act.

Unsafe food: Food whose nature, substance or quality is so affected as to render it injurious to health.

Misbranded food: Food that is offered or promoted for sale with false, misleading or deceptive claims either on its label or through advertising.

Sub-standard food: Food that does not meet the specified standards but is not unsafe.

Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI): The apex statutory body for regulating the food sector in India.

PART II: HISTORICAL LEGISLATION
1. The Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (PFA Act) [Repealed]
Description: This was the primary law governing food safety in India for over five decades before it was repealed and replaced by the FSS Act, 2006. The PFA Act's main objective was to prevent the adulteration of food. However, it was criticized for its narrow focus on adulteration rather than the broader concept of food safety, and for its punitive rather than preventive approach. The FSS Act, 2006, represents a paradigm shift from the PFA regime by adopting a science-based, risk-assessment approach to food safety.

PART III: OTHER RELEVANT LAWS
1. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019
Description: While the FSS Act regulates the food industry, the Consumer Protection Act empowers the consumer. A person who has purchased food that is defective or unsafe can seek redressal under this Act.

Relevance to Food Law:

Defective Goods: Unsafe, sub-standard, or misbranded food can be considered "defective goods" under the Consumer Protection Act.

Remedy: A consumer can file a complaint in the appropriate Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (District, State, or National) to claim compensation for any loss or injury suffered due to the consumption of such food. This provides a direct and often speedier remedy for the individual consumer, which is parallel to any action that may be taken by the food safety authorities under the FSS Act.

2. The Legal Metrology Act, 2009
Description: This Act establishes and enforces standards of weights and measures. It regulates trade and commerce in goods which are sold or distributed by weight, measure or number.

Relevance to Food Law:

Packaged Commodities: The Act, along with the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 2011, is highly relevant for packaged food products.

Mandatory Declarations: It mandates that all pre-packaged commodities (including food items) must bear certain declarations on the label, such as the name and address of the manufacturer, the common name of the commodity, the net quantity, the date of manufacture, and the maximum retail price (MRP).

Consumer Protection: This ensures that consumers are given accurate information about the quantity and price of the food products they are buying, protecting them from unfair trade practices related to weights and measures.
