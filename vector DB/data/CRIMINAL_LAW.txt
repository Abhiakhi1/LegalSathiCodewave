INTRODUCTORY OVERVIEW OF CRIMINAL LAW
What is Criminal Law?
Criminal Law is the body of law that relates to crime. It proscribes conduct perceived as threatening, harmful, or otherwise endangering to the property, health, safety, and moral welfare of people. It includes the punishment and rehabilitation of people who violate such laws. The criminal justice system in India underwent a historic transformation in 2023, with the enactment of three new laws that replaced the colonial-era criminal codes. The new laws—the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023; the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023; and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023—came into effect on July 1, 2024, representing a significant paradigm shift aimed at decolonizing and modernizing Indian criminal jurisprudence.
